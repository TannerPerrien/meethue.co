sections:
- name: 2nd vs 3rd Generation
  content: The 3rd gen Hue lights produce colors that are more vibrant compared to
    their 2nd gen predecessors. This is most apparent when producing blues and greens.
    The 2nd gen bulbs produced teal-like blues and lime-like greens. The 3rd gen bulbs
    equivalents produce colors that are true to the spectrum.
- name: Color vs Ambiance vs White
  content: The Hue lineup offers three different light bulb options. Color bulbs allow
    you to pick any color you want. Ambiance bulbs allow you to pick from many different
    shades of white. This allows flexibilty between a warm, inviting environment and
    an environment geared for focus. White bulbs offer the least in terms of features,
    but still leave you in control for dimming and turning on/off. Read more about
    choosing bulbs and color temperature in the <a href="/guides/3-steps-to-hue-the-guide-you-wish-you-had-read-first/">Hue
    Lighting Guide</a>.
- name: Light/Bridge Compatibility
  content: All lights and bridges are compatible. For example, 1st gen lights will
    work with a 2nd gen bridge. Likewise, 2nd and 3rd gen lights will work with a
    1st gen bridge.
