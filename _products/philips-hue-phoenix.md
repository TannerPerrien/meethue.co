sections:
- name: Phoenix vs Beyond
  content: 'The Phoenix and Beyond product lineups both offer plug-n-play table lamps
    along with wired fixtures ideal for a new home or home remodel. Two things set
    the Beyond and Phoenix linups apart: price and colored lighting. The Beyond lineup
    allows you to paint your room with color, but at a price, literally. The Beyond
    lights are significantly more expensive than the Phoenix fixtures, but the Phoenix
    fixtures can only produce white light at different color temperatures.'
- name: Color vs Ambiance vs White
  content: The Hue lineup offers three different light bulb options. This lamp falls
    in the Ambiance lineup. Color bulbs allow you to pick any color you want. Ambiance
    bulbs allow you to pick from many different shades of white. This allows flexibilty
    between a warm, inviting environment and an environment geared for focus. White
    bulbs offer the least in terms of features, but still leave you in control for
    dimming and turning on/off. Read more about choosing bulbs and color temperature
