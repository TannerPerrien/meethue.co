    The 3 hour battery life and built-in lighting presets allow you to put light in
    the exact space you want.
- name: But I have to plug it in all the time? No thanks!
  content: 'You''re wondering. I''m wondering. We''re all wondering. There is an answer:
    charge the Go in a space where it can commonly be used. It will work great as
    a light in the place for most of the time. You can add IFTTT recipes to make the
    Go flash a color of light when your favorite team scores or when your loved one
    is heading home, along with many other creative ideas. Or put the Go next to your
    bedside and have it wake you with deep dimming so that you start your day off
    fresh and energized.'
