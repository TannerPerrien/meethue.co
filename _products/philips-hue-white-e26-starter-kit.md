sections:
- name: Color vs Ambiance vs White
  content: The Hue lineup offers three different light bulb options. Color bulbs allow
    you to pick any color you want. Ambiance bulbs allow you to pick from many different
    shades of white. This allows flexibilty between a warm, inviting environment and
    an environment geared for focus. White bulbs offer the least in terms of features,
    but still leave you in control for dimming and turning on/off. Read more about
    choosing bulbs and color temperature in the <a href="/guides/3-steps-to-hue-the-guide-you-wish-you-had-read-first/">Hue
    Lighting Guide</a>.
