sections:
- name: How is this different than the LightStrip?
  content: You may find the LightStrip being sold elsewhere on the web, but be warned
    that the regular LightStrip is the 1st generation lightstrip and is considerably
    less bright than the LightStrip Plus! If you find a good deal on the 1st gen and
    don't need the extra brightness, go for it. However, take note that the exact
    color output may vary, so you would be best advised to not mix and match the 1st
    gen and 2nd gen lightstrips too close to each other.
