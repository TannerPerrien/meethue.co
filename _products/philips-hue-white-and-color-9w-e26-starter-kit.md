sections:
- name: Color vs Ambiance vs White
  content: The Hue lineup offers three different light bulb options. Color bulbs allow
    you to pick any color you want. Ambiance bulbs allow you to pick from many different

    but still leave you in control for dimming and turning on/off. Read more about
