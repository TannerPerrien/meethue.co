  Tidy up your Hue lights: Organize them in groups, let them light up in your favorite colors, depending on where you are and how you feel. Want to go to bed? Just start up the integrated sleep timer and close your eyes. Have got a Hue Tap or Hue Dimmer and want more flexibility? Colors, Presets (like scenes), sleep timers, brightness, blinking, on/off and (with animation editor purchase) even color animations! Apply colors to your group, drag & drop them, or save them as favorite.
